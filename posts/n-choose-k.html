            <section class="content">
                <p>I'm home for winter break, which has meant long morning walks
                    - inspired (a little) by <a
                        href="https://x.com/OxUniMaths/status/1909991978835550325"
                        target="_blank">Roger Penrose</a>. On today's walk I
                    decided to try deriving the formula for ${n \choose k}$.
                    Almost immediately, I recalled the familiar-looking
                    formula</p>

                $${n \choose k}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$$

                <p>But it's not that interesting to simply regurgitate what I
                    learned in high school. Suppose we take the formula as
                    given. The real question is: how do we work backwards from
                    $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$ to see, cleanly, why it counts the
                    number of <em>distinct</em> ways to choose $k$ items from a
                    set of $n$?</p>

                <p>The numerator is $n!$,<span
                        class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote">A
                        disclaimer: most of what I'll say next is probably
                        trivial. I'm going to talk about it as if it isn't, to
                        walk through how I thought about this. There will likely
                        be parts that are over-explained.</span> which we know
                    is the number of ways to
                    order $n$ items. This seems odd - we're trying to count
                    selections, not orderings.</p>

                <p>How does that relate to choosing $k$ items?</p>

                <p>It turns out there's an equivalent framing that makes the
                    $n!$ sensible. Take an ordering of all $n$ items, and
                    declare that the "chosen" items are simply the first $k$
                    items in the ordering. The remaining $n-k$ are "not chosen."
                    Now every permutation of $n$ items induces a choice.</p>

                <p>Now we're overcounting, in two ways. First, we don't care how
                    the unchosen $n-k$ items are ordered among themselves -
                    that's $(n-k)!$ redundant arrangements. Second, we don't
                    care how the chosen $k$ items are ordered either - that's
                    $k!$ more. Dividing by both gives us</p>

                $${n \choose k}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$$

                <p style="text-align: center;">⁂</p>

                <p>After working through the permutation argument, I had the
                    slightly annoying realization that I'd taken the long way
                    around. It turns out there's a nicer version of the ${n
                    \choose k}$ formula, which is (in my opinion) more
                    intuitive.</p>

                <p>Notice:</p>
                $$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
                =\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-(k-1))(n-k)!}{(n-k)!}
                =n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)$$

                <p>So we can rewrite</p>

                $${n \choose k}=\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!}$$

                <p>Why is this nicer? The numerator now has a direct
                    interpretation: it's simply the number of ways to choose $k$
                    items
                    <em>in order</em>.<span class="sidenote-number"></span><span
                        class="sidenote">This numerator is called a <em>falling
                            factorial</em>, sometimes written $(n)_k =
                        n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)$.</span> Pick the first item: $n$
                    choices. Pick the second: $n-1$ remain. And so on, until
                    you've made $k$ picks. This is probably what you'd
                    first write down if you tried to derive ${n \choose k}$ from
                    scratch. Then we divide by $k!$ because we don't care about
                    the order in which we picked them.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">⁂</p>

                <p>So the formula is basically: count choices <em>with</em>
                    order, then divide out the ordering importance. In one view,
                    you consider permutations and ignore orderings
                    within the first $k$ slots and within the last $n-k$ slots.
                    In the other view, you count $k$-step picks directly via the
                    falling factorial and then divide by $k!$. Either way you
                    land at the same object:</p>

                $${n \choose
                k}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}=\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!}$$

                <p>Both formulas have their place. The first form,
                    $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$, is symmetric in $k$ and $n-k$, which
                    makes it useful in proofs, e.g. it's immediately obvious
                    that ${n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k}$. The second form,
                    $\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!}$, is computationally nicer:
                    you only multiply $k$ terms in the numerator instead of $n$,
                    which matters when $k$ is small relative to $n$.</p>

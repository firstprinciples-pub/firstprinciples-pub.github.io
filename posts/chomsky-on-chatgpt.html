                        his main take is that ChatGPT is obviously better at
                        humans by certain definitions, but also people who
                        claim
                        we've solved intelligence aren't right cause LLMs
                        don't
                        give us useful insights into intelligence since
                        they're
                        very hard to reverse engineer and interpret<br>I

                        that
                        Chomsky is out of touch, but based on this he

                        he def makes a point to mention that AI is useful in

                        don't think anyone's doubting that LLMs are useful.
                        What
                        we're doubting is how useful it is. If it's the case
                        that LLMs by being approximations of human cognition
                        (by
                        proxy of being approximations of language) then that
                        means it can do a shit ton more than if it's just
                        approximations for human language.</div>

                        that point it's a neuroscience issue as we don't
                        know
                        how humans generate language or how we
                        think<br>Hence we

                        is where Noam would disagree, relevant quote from
                        article:<br>"It's true that chatbots cannot in principle match the linguistic competence of humans, for the reasons repeated above. Their basic design prevents them from reaching the minimal condition of adequacy for a theory of human language: distinguishing possible from impossible languages. Since that is a property of the design, it cannot be overcome by future innovations in this kind of AI. However, it is quite possible that future engineering projects will match and even surpass human capabilities, if we mean human capacity to act, performance. As mentioned above, some have long done so: automatic calculators for example. More interestingly, as mentioned, insects with minuscule brains surpass human capacities understood as competence."<br>E.g
                        LLMs aren't learning good models of language</div>
